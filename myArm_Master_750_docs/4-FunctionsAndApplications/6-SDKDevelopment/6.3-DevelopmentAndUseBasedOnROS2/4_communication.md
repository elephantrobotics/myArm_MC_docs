# correspondence
  Our MyarmM750 mainly uses a **Topic** method for communication  
   
   > Topic is one of the most commonly used communication mechanisms in ROS, which is based on the publisher-subscriber model, in which one node publishes messages as publishers and other nodes receive messages as subscribers. A publisher can publish messages to multiple subscribers at the same time, and subscribers can receive messages from multiple publishers. This approach is ideal for situations that require real-time data updates, such as processing and real-time control of sensor data.    

Start by creating a Publisher in the .py file to publish our message to the MyarmM750

Next, open the terminal in the workspace and start ROS2:    
> colcon build 
 
> soure install/setup.bash  
> ros2 launch myarm_m750 test.launch.py

Open RVIZ and then launch our **read_control.py** file

To create a new terminal in the workspace, enter the following command, first look at the running node, then look at the PID of the **joint_state_publisher** node, and finally kill the number string generated by this node:  
> ros2 node list  
> ps aux | grep joint_state_publisher   
>  kill 32695  #This string of numbers is generated at random

Finally, we open a new terminal and enter:  
> rqt_graph 

We can see all the information about the node

The MyarmM750 is also in a state where it can be manually moved
