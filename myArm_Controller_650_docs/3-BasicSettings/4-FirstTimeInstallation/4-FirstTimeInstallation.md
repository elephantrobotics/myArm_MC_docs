# 3. Power-On Test Guide

## 3.1 Structural Installation and Fixation

The myArm weighs 1.8 kilograms. Because the center of gravity changes with the robot's movement during use, it is required that the robot be fixed on a sturdy base at the beginning. Both fixed and mobile bases are acceptable.

### Graphic Guide

#### Basic Interface Dimensions

- The base fixing hole is the interface between the robot and other bases or surfaces. The specific hole size is shown in the figure below. There are 4 counterbores with a diameter of 4.5 millimeters, which can be fixed with M6 bolts.

<img src="../../../myArm_Controller_650_docs\resources\3-BasicSettings\4-FirstTimeInstallation\底座尺寸.jpg" alt="img-1" width="400" height=“auto” /> <br>

- The end is equipped with a flange for compatibility with LEGO component holes and threaded holes. Before installation, make sure there are corresponding threaded holes on the fixed base.

#### Before Installation, Please Confirm

- Environmental conditions meet the requirements listed.
- The installation location is not smaller than the robot's working range, and there is sufficient space for installation, use, maintenance, and repair.
- Place the base in the appropriate position.
- Prepare tools related to installation, such as screws, wrenches, etc.
- After confirming the above steps, move the robot to the base installation platform, adjust the position of the robot, align the fixing holes of the robot base with the holes on the base installation platform, align the screws with the holes, and tighten them after aligning.

> **Note:** When adjusting the position of the robot on the base installation platform, do not push or pull the robot directly on the base installation platform to avoid scratching. When manually moving the robot, do not apply external force to the vulnerable parts of the robot to avoid unnecessary damage to the robot.

- After the robot is installed, cable connection and use can be performed.

## 3.2 External Cable Connection

### Graphic Guide

Before operation, please ensure that you have read the **Chapter 3 Safety Instructions** to ensure safe operation. At the same time, connect the power adapter to the mechanical arm and fix the mechanical arm base on the desktop.

The myArm must be powered by an external power supply to provide sufficient power:

- Rated Voltage: 12V
- Rated Current: 5A
- Plug Type: DC Circular Interface

**Please note that you cannot only use TypeC for power supply.** Please use the officially recognized power supply to avoid damage to the mechanical arm.

The use case diagram is shown in the figure below: (Please align the use case diagram carefully for connection)
