## 4. Common Questions

### How to Ask Questions Gracefully

#### 1. Phenomena Encountered in Various Places of Inquiry:

- No response after asking a question.
- It takes a long time for someone to respond to the question.
- The other party always belittles oneself.

#### 2. Before Asking Questions, Please Make Sure You Have Studied This Manual.

Many questions can be resolved during this process. Avoid randomly asking questions in QQ groups, forums, issues, or emails, as many questions that are explained in the documentation from the beginning may not receive timely responses from the community. To save everyone's time and create a better community environment for mutual growth, please understand each other.

#### 3. When Asking Questions, Try to Do the Following to Greatly Increase the Chance of Quickly Solving the Problem:

##### Understand What Happened, What I Did, Including:

- What effect do I want to achieve, what function?
- How did I do it to achieve this effect, what is the specific process?
- What errors occurred during the implementation, what symptoms (e.g., what is the reported error, the **complete** error message)?
- Did I carefully read the error message? Does the error message provide the cause of the error and the solution?
- Based on these error messages, think carefully, can I solve the problem?
- Search the documentation, issues, and use a search engine to find solutions to the problem?

#### 4. If I Can't Solve the Problem Myself and Need to Ask for Help, I Need to Consider:

- Whom to ask, where to ask, who is more likely to answer my question? And how timely is it?
- What data and phenomena should I provide to him so that he can quickly help me solve the problem?

  - Provide my purpose (to let the answerer know what you are doing)
  - Provide the complete implementation process, as well as the phenomena encountered in the process (to facilitate the answerer to follow your process to reproduce the problem)
  - Point out the places where errors occurred, indicate where the phenomena or results differ from expectations! (Let the answerer know where it did not meet expectations)
  - Provide error information, need to be complete, as many screenshots and logs as possible, don't be stingy with screenshots, or only provide a part of the logs (because the answerer may not have done this for a long time and may have forgotten some details, need screenshots and complete logs to quickly recall; and according to the detailed logs, the problem can be quickly located)

- How to ask questions in a sincere manner, even if I am a newbie, everyone is willing to answer

#### 5. Question Template

When asking questions, try to ask elegantly, without adding unnecessary particles, complaining words, carefully consider each word and punctuation mark, think from the perspective of the person answering the question, how to help the person answering the question quickly solve the problem, the description is not clear if the number of words is too small, if the number of words is too large, people will not have patience.

#### 6. Title

No matter where you ask questions (including `QQ group`), give yourself a title of about 30 words, clarify the central idea of the question, including:

- The category of the question, whether it is a question, a BUG submission, or an experience sharing, etc. Let everyone know immediately on the screen full of text what you want to do
- A sentence to clarify the central idea of the question, such as `Running the camera sample program, reporting reset fail, could it be a hardware problem`

So the title can be like this:

- `【mycobot Question】Running the camera sample program, reporting reset fail, could it be a hardware problem?`

Titles like these should be **avoided**:

- `Ah ah ah why is my board not working again`
- `Why can't my code run`
- `Why is my screen black`
- `【mycobot question】Received the development board, the screen is red, one line of small characters, why`
- `I ran xxx program, there was a problem`

You can ask like this:

- `【mycobot question】My board cannot start after I connect the power supply reversely. How to judge which part of the board is burned out? If possible, how can I revive it?`

#### 7. Content

First of all, think from the perspective of the person answering the question:

- First of all, I need to know what the other party wants to do, what goals to achieve
- In order to achieve this goal, what steps did they take, and then at which step the problem occurred, so that I can try to reproduce the phenomenon based on their steps. If this problem seems difficult to solve and there are no steps to reproduce, it may take a lot of time to reproduce, so let's put it aside and solve other problems first
- Specifically, what problems occurred, if he only mentioned the problem, how do I know what problem he encountered? Maybe he was physically uncomfortable? So this is very important, let him describe the phenomenon when the problem occurred, and indicate what is different from the expectation, otherwise, I have to guess what is different from the expectation, the length of solving the problem increases
- When there is a problem, I may need his log file, so that I can analyze the source code according to the log, otherwise it may be difficult to solve the problem, then this problem can be put aside and solved slowly
- In summary, you can ask like this:
- Clearly state your goals, what you want to do, what the phenomenon should be like
- Did I refer to any documents, code, or tutorials
- How to reproduce the error: what specific steps, write in detail, until the problem occurs
- Describe in detail the phenomenon when the error occurred, and what is different from the expected, need to prove that the problem really occurred
- Attach log files, screenshots, or even videos, logs and screenshots must be complete, do not just take a small part, the answerer may find some problems that you did not notice from your complete logs and screenshots, this is very important
- In addition, pay attention to the format when pasting the code, don't paste it after it is messy and unreadable, try to copy it directly so that it can run
- Finally, express gratitude to the community friends who answered the questions

### Driver Related

#### 1. About Python

**Q: What do the parameters in the API `send_coords([x,y,z,rx,ry,rz], speed, 1)` mean, and what are the corresponding Euler angles rx, ry, rz? What is the rotation order of Euler angles? And what are the ranges of each parameter?**

- A: The parameters in the array are the end coordinates of the robot arm, speed is the speed, and the last parameter is the motion mode. rx, ry, rz correspond to rpy, which stands for roll, pitch, and yaw respectively. The Euler angle order is zyx, where zyx is the body coordinate. X, Y, Z range from -300 to 300.00 (the range is undefined, exceeding the range will return "inverse kinematics no solution" prompt), and rx, ry, rz range from -180 to 180.

#### 2. About ROS

**Q: How does the myCobot based on microcontroller and the myCobot based on microprocessor run ROS?**

- A: The myCobot based on the microcontroller is currently running on Ubuntu, and you need to download a virtual machine to set up a virtual environment and install the Ubuntu system in the virtual environment to run ROS. You can also develop your own ROS. The myCobot based on the microprocessor comes with a ROS environment and can be used directly.

**Can the myCobot based on the microprocessor be connected to a PC for use with ROS and MoveIt?**

- A: There is currently no direct communication control in the open-source materials. You can achieve it by modifying existing node files through ROS + socket.

**Q: Can you provide the rviz model file and programming examples?**

- A: They are available on our GitHub.
  "https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mycobot_ros"

**Q: When running the rviz model file with ROS, why does it report permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0'?**

- A: Because the serial port permission is not granted. You should enter `sudo chmod 777 port name` in the terminal.
  For example:
  ```
  sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
  ```

**Q: When running the ROS slider control and model following commands, why does it report init() takes exactly 2 arguments(3 given)?**

- A: The pymycobot library is not installed and started.

**Q: When using ROS, why do the arm angles and model angles in rviz not match?**

- A: It is likely that the zero position of the robot arm has not been calibrated, and you need to calibrate the zero position of the robot arm.

### Software Issues

**Q: Why can't my compiler find the corresponding device?**

- A: You need to set up the development environment and install the corresponding project library before you can develop the device.

#### 1. About myStudio

**Q: What is myStudio?**

- A: It is a self-developed software by our company. It is a tool for firmware burning or modification for the existing robotic arms launched by our company. [More](../../5-BasicApplication/5.2-ApplicationUse/5.2.2-mystudio/320m5/README.md)

**Q: Can the drag and teach in the firmware record gripper actions?**

- A: Currently, drag-and-teach cannot record gripper actions because the gripper belongs to joint 7, and our drag-and-teach can only record and play back the movements of joints 1-6.

**Q: Even after burning the minirobot firmware, why can't I use drag and teach?**

- A: First, check if both the M5Stack-basic firmware and the atom firmware are burned, if the burned firmware corresponds to the requirements and if it is the latest version of the firmware.
  It is recommended to burn the minirobot firmware to version v2.1, and the top atommain firmware to version v4.1 or above (requires support for mystudio version v4.3.1 or above).

**Q: What version of firmware should be burned for the myCobot phone controller app?**

- A: You need to burn the atom firmware atommain2.5 version in mystudio.

**Q: Why does myStudio not recognize the serial port of myCobot? What should I do?**

- A: If your computer does not prompt that myCobot is connected, install the serial port driver program first.
   Also, note that the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Jetson Nano series robotic arms **cannot be connected to a laptop** via a data cable and need to use mystudio for firmware burning in the built-in system.

**Q: Can the trajectories recorded by drag-and-teach be stored in the card?**

- A: Currently, it cannot be stored in the memory card. Also, drag-and-teach can only store one path at a time, and the next recording will overwrite the previous action.

#### 2. About RoboFlow

**Q: Can RobotStudio software programming be used?**

- A: Our own industrial programming software roboFlow can be used, but RobotStudio is from ABB and cannot be interoperable with us.

**Q: What is the reason for RoboFlow software to quickly move beyond the limit?**

- A: It may be that one or more joints exceed the limit.

**Q: How to load the written program in roboFlow software?**

- A: After logging in, select the robot program, and then click Load Program. You cannot directly click Run Program, you can only click pro600.

#### 3. About myblockly

**Q: Why does a dialog box always appear when running myblockly?**

- A: Before running myblockly, please close the serial port occupation.

**Q: When running myblockly, why does it display child process exited with code 0?**

- A: This is not an error. The real error needs to be analyzed one by one. This string represents the end of the program and returns binary number 0, indicating termination.

#### 4. About ROS1

**Q: When switching the terminal to `~/catkin_ws/src` and using git to install and update `mycobot_ros`, why does it seem that the target path "mycobot_ros" already exists?**

- A: There is already a `mycobot_ros` package in `~/catkin_ws/src`, so you need to delete it first and then rerun git.

**Q: When running rosrun, why does the terminal report `counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB

0: Permission: '/dev/ttyUSB0'`?**

- A: Insufficient serial port permission. Enter `sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0` to grant permission.

**Q: Why can't ROS programs run in vscode?**

- A: Because the vscode terminal cannot load the ROS environment, you need to run it on the system terminal.

**Q: When running rosrun, why does the terminal prompt `Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying`?**

- A: Before running ROS programs, you need to start the ROS node by entering `roscore` in the terminal.

**Q: When running rosrun, why does the terminal report `counld not open port /dev/ttyUSB0：No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyUSB1'`?**

- A: The serial port is incorrect. Confirm the actual serial port of the current robotic arm. You can use `ls /dev/tty*` to check.

**Q: When building code in Ubuntu18.04 with catkin_make, the build fails with errors such as `Project 'cv_bridge' specifies '/usr/include/opencv' as an include dir, which is not found.` What is the reason?**

- A: The opencv path in the configuration file does not match the actual path of the system. You need to use sudo to modify the configuration file (the path is `/opt/ros/melodic/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake`), and the actual opencv path of the system is located in `/usr/include/`.

**Q: After compilation, when running launch instructions in a new terminal, why does it show the following error?**

![alt text](../../resources/3-BasicSettings/3-UserInstructions/ros_error.png)

- A1: The ROS environment variables are not added to the system, so you need to source them every time you open a new terminal:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
```

- A2: The ROS environment variables are added to the system, so you don't need to execute source every time you open a new terminal:

```bash
# The noetic is Ubuntu20.04 system
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- A3: It may be that the file name in the instruction does not match the actual file name in the mycobot_ros package. Please carefully check if there is any error in the instruction.

### Hardware Issues

**Q: What controls the six servos?**

A2: The servos are controlled by the atom on the top.

**Q: What is the role of the atom in the robotic arm?**

A3: It controls the robot through forward and inverse kinematics and coordinate transformation algorithms. The Atom is not open source yet.

### Communication-related Issues

**Q: Why, after connecting the robotic arm with an HDMI cable, does the screen not display? Is it necessary to download port driver program?**

A1: Check if the connection is correct and if the power is turned on. Try using other interfaces and insert them steadily. There is no need to download the port driver program.

**Q: Which versions of communication interfaces are supported by different robotic arms?**

A2: The robotic arms based on microprocessors support socket communication TCP; the robotic arms based on microcontrollers can communicate via USB to serial port.

**Q: What is the communication frequency of the robotic arm?**

A3: 10-20Hz.
